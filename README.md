# tensorFlow_learn


Hello guys, I have recently started with the deep learning course on udacity by Google. The course is very vast in its premise, so a lot of new concepts and models need to be covered in it. 

Tensorflow is the main library being used to implement ml and deep learning, so going through its official documentation https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started

All the test files and models implemented using tensorflow are posted on this repository.
